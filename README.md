# Quantum-simulation
This repository is about my projects at a bachelor level

The project is a continued project from Jirayu Mongkolkiattichai who is my older labmate and advised by Asst.Prof. Narupon Chattrapiban.

This project is used to simulate the moving wave function in any interesting potential well/wall.
Within the progress, the spectral method is used to solve the Gross Pitaevskii equation and animated.
